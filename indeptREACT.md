# REACT start, Terms & Methods

## Working with State
Components can have "state" which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves

"App" or "global" state refers to state that is available to the entire UI, not just a single component.

Prior to React 16.8, it was class based components to use use. Now we can use functional components with hooks.

    Hooks in React are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components, rather than just in class components.
