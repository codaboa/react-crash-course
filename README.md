# What is REACT (framework, SPA)
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to build web and mobile applications with reusable components, which can improve development speed and help manage the complexity of large projects.

        HINT: When using REACT, think of your UI as a bunch of separate components

# SPA vs PvP
PvP stands for "Page-by-Page" and refers to the traditional way of building web applications, where each page is a separate document that is loaded from the server each time a user navigates to it. This architecture is often used for traditional websites, where the majority of the content is static.

SPA stands for "Single-Page Application" and refers to web applications that load a single HTML document and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the application. This architecture is often used for more complex web applications, such as those that involve real-time updates or a lot of user interaction.

In summary, the main difference between PvP and SPA is that the former loads a new page each time the user navigates while the latter loads a single page and dynamically updates the content.

## Why use REACT
* Reusable components: React allows developers to build reusable components, which can be easily reused throughout a project and make development faster and more efficient.

* Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. This improves the performance of web applications by minimizing the amount of updates that need to be made to the actual DOM.

* One-way data flow: React uses a one-way data flow, which makes it easy to understand how data is flowing through an application and makes it easier to debug.

* Popularity: React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces, and as a result, has a large and active community, which means that developers have access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and support.

* Large ecosystem: React is a part of large ecosystem of technologies, such as React Router, Redux, and Next.js, that can be used to build complete web application.

* Cross platform development: React Native, a library built on top of React, allows to build mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms with the same codebase.
